# Corporate Open Source Guide

This guide assists a corporate based open source program office organize and communicate guidance for open source activities within the organization.

## Background

We encourage tech companies to set and communicate guidelines to help support engineers with open source questions. Our guide addresses the common questions that engineers face: e.g. _can I use this code in my project?, can I contribute code to a project I use?, where do we publish code we want to share with others?_ etc.

This guide is built using GitHub Pages with Jekyll and the Just the Docs theme.
